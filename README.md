# NBA-Sports-Final-Project-Files
This repository includes all the code, visuals, the report, and PowerPoint that were required for the final submission for Professor Ronak

We have posted the links thats take you too the visual and code down below so you don't have to go through the trouble to run the code. Some files are on vegaltie so using the links would prove to be a more effecient method

However, if want to run the files yourself, you can use google colab or jupyter notebook since they are mostly .ipynb files.
