# NBA-Sports-Final-Project-Files
This repository includes all the code, visuals, the report, and PowerPoint that were required for the final submission for Professor Ronak

We have included all the code files in the repository, inorder to run the files you can use google colab or jupyter notebook since they are mostly .ipynv files.
However, we have posted the links to all the visual down below so you don't have to go through the trouble to run the code. Some files are on vegaltie so using the links would prove to be a more effecient method
